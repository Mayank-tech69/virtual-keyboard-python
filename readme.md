Welcome to the *Virtual Keyboard* – a revolutionary software-based keyboard that allows users to type using hand gestures! 🤲💻 This project uses *OpenCV* for real-time image processing and *Mediapipe* for precise hand tracking, offering a *gesture-controlled keyboard* for users with physical limitations or anyone who prefers hands-free typing. 👋✍

Simply use your hands in front of a webcam, and the system will detect gestures that correspond to keys on a virtual QWERTY layout. No more physical typing – just intuitive hand gestures! 🎉
